# Biography

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Karolinska Institutet where I works with Jens Hjerling-Leffler. I gained an undergraduate degree in Artificial Intelligence and Cybernetics from the University of Reading in 2008, followed by an MPhil at the University of Cambridge in Computational Biology in 2009.  I went onto do a PhD in Molecular Biology at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute working with Prof Seth Grant. During this time I worked on the Genes to Cognition programme, analysing the transcriptomic changes seen in a mice carrying a wide range of synaptic mutations. 

Following my PhD I worked at the University of Edinburgh, where I studied how postnatal gene expression changes influence the onset of psychiatric disorders. I then begun a postdoctoral position split between University College London and the Karolinska Institutet where I built upon my work with single cell RNA-seq. 

My interests lie in using human genetics to gain insight into the neurobiology of psychiatric disorders and cognitive traits. Currently I am focused on identifying the causal cell types underlying complex genetic traits.
