      <description>I am an independent Safra research fellow at Imperial College&amp;rsquo;s Dementia Research Institute. My interests lie in using human genetics to gain insight into the neurobiology of brain disorders and cognitive traits. Currently I am focused on identifying the causal cell types underlying complex genetic traits. The motivation for this is that traditional approaches to science have been unable to yield definitive answers on which cell types are the primary cause of major diseases, such as Schizophrenia or Alzheimers.</description>
