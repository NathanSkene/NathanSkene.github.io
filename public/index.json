We aim to be develop the methods and datasets required to enable these questions to be answered systematically for any trait for which well-powered genetic data is available.\nThe most complete and unbiased data source currently available for the brain comes from single cell RNA-sequencing: an atlas of almost every cell type found in the central, peripheral and enteric nervous system is available. Using this dataset and other\u0026rsquo;s like it we have investigated the cell types underlying Schizophrenia, Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s disease, Parkinsons, Stroke and cognitive ability. To get greater accuracy in interpreting genetic data we need to go beyond mouse single cell RNA-seq data though: we plan to obtain human cell atlases using ATAC-seq and other genomic techniques.\nUsing transcriptomic datasets mapping expression changes across the lifespan we have investigated why the onset of psychiatric diseases occurs in early adulthood (rather than in infancy, as would be expected for heavily genetic disorders). Currently this kind of data is only available for a small number of brain regions; we are looking to generate new datasets spanning the human lifespan for a range of disease relevant cell types.\nIdentifying the causal cell types and developmental stages will not in itself lead to cures though. To get closer to that we need to understand what changes occur on the affected cells. Our approach is based on the notion that the causal changes associated with disease will be quantitative traits, much like height or BMI, but the important changes will be on the cellular level for specific subtypes of cells (i.e. increased spine density in Reln/Ndnf+ cortical interneurons). To identify these changes and link them to genetics we need higher throughput biological methods. Towards this end we are building on the work of collaborators to develop spatial transcriptomic techniques to enable simultaneous automated identification of all cell types found in tissue sections.\nLooking for a postdoc, internship, masters or PhD?

My interests lie in using human genetics to gain insight into the neurobiology of brain disorders and cognitive traits. Currently I am focused on identifying the causal cell types underlying complex genetic traits. The motivation for this is that traditional approaches to science have been unable to yield definitive answers on which cell types are the primary cause of major diseases, such as Schizophrenia or Alzheimers. For instance, as the primary pathology in Alzheimers is neuronal/synapse loss, it was reasonably assumed for many years that the cause was neuronal, however analysis of genetic associatons shows that most of the causal genes are expressed in microglia.\nI did my postdoctoral research at the Karolinska Institutet (KI) where I worked with Jens Hjerling-Leffler as part of the Functional Neuromics project. At KI we adapted single cell disassociation protocols such that we could obtain sufficient numbers of healthy interneurons from adult mice that we could catalogue the full complement of GABAergic cell types found in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. This work formed part of a broader effort to map all the cell types in the mouse nervous system using single cell RNA-sequencing (the completed atlas can be viewed here). To enable greater insight into which of these cell types play a role in human disease/cognition we begun collaborating with Patrick Sullivan\u0026rsquo;s psychiatric genetics team: together we established the methods which enabled us to map the cell types underlying Schizophrenia, Major Depression, IQ, Neuroticism, Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s and Insomnia. We released the MAGMA_Celltyping package to enable others to apply this method to future GWAS studies. The KI single cell superset data which we used for cell type mapping is available here.\nI gained an undergraduate degree in Artificial Intelligence and Cybernetics from the University of Reading in 2008, followed by an MPhil at the University of Cambridge in Computational Biology in 2009. I went onto do a PhD in Molecular Biology at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute working with Prof Seth Grant. During this time I worked on the Genes to Cognition programme, analysing the transcriptomic changes seen in a mice carrying a wide range of synaptic mutations.\nFollowing my PhD I worked at the University of Edinburgh, where I studied how postnatal gene expression changes influence the onset of psychiatric disorders. At this time I developed a method (Expression Weighted Celltype Enrichment) which made it possible to show that microglia are the celltype whose expression profile best explains the rare \u0026amp; common variant\u0026rsquo;s associated with Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s disease.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6e21f98d6a92104f2def25be3eba683f","permalink":"/authors/nathanskene/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/nathanskene/","section":"author","summary":"I am an independent Safra research fellow at Imperial College\u0026rsquo;s Dementia Research Institute.

Some of the most exciting findings relate to Parkinson\u0026rsquo;s disease: we discover genetic associations with most the celltypes known to degenerate in the disease (suggesting this occurs cell autonomously) but also discovered a new link to Oligodendrocytes.\nWe tested for associations with 231 cell types from the mouse central, peripheral and enteric nervous systems. We used single cell transcriptome data from @slinnarsson recent cell type atlas.\n  As in our previous paper (https://is.gd/Vwval4 ) we used two distinct methods: MAGMA tested for a positive relationship between gene specificity and gene-level genetic associations; LDSC tested if the 10% most specific genes in a cell are enriched for trait heritability.\n  As with our previous schizophrenia findings, the strongest signals were in cortical + CA1 pyramidal neurons, D2 medium spiny neurons, and Reln/Ndnf expressing interneurons. Importantly however, we also found another strongly enriched cell type in the superior colliculus (MEGLU6)\nExcitatory neurons from cortical layer 5 (TEGLU4) project to the superior colliculus and to the striatum. MEGLU6 is located in the superior colliculus, while MSN2 is located in the striatum. This may imply a circuit between these cell types may be disrupted in schizophrenia.\nAs before, we did not observe any significant associations with immune or vascular cells for schizophrenia nor any other psychiatric disorders or cognitive traits.\n  BMI had strongest associations with neurons in the midbrain (MEGLU10), hypothalamus (DEINH3) and solitary nucleus (HBGLU3). The hypothalamus is plays a major role in weight regulation, and the solitary nucleus is involved in gustatory processing and projects to the hypothalamus\n  Stroke and migraine were significantly associated with arterial smooth muscle cells (VSMCA), indicating that vascular process play a central role in these traits.\n  Thanks to @23andMeResearch we were able to analyse a new Parkinsons GWAS (12,657 cases, 941,588 controls). We meta-analysed this with an existing PD GWAS (9,581 cases, 33,245 controls). This was exciting as the hallmark sign of PD is degeneration of a specific cell type.\nThe degenerating cells (MBDOP2) were highly associated with the PD common variants. Strikingly, other cell types which degenerate in PD also showed strong associations, including serotonergic raphe nucleus neurons (HBSER2) and cholinergic neurons of the Pons (HBCHO2)\n  While the neuronal associations with PD confirmed our expectations, we also found strong association with the oligodendrocyte lineage (NFOL2, MFOL1, COP1, NFOL1, MOL1, MFOL2, COP2, MOL2) which was totally unexpected.\nWe tested if the oligodendrocyte lineage cells shared a common genetic disease mechanism with the neuronal cell types, using a conditional enrichment approach. While the neurons (i.e. MBDOP2 and HBSER2) shared mechanisms together, this did not overlap with oligodendrocytes.\n  Our results suggest that shared biological mechanisms intrinsic to MBDOP2 and HBSER2 neuronal cell types lead to their selective loss in Parkinsons disease. They also indicate that a separate and hitherto unknown disease mechanisms exists involving oligodendrocytes.\nStruck by the novelty of this link between Parkinsons and Oligodendrocyte lineage cells we set out to establish if further evidence would either support or refute this.\nWe used EWCE to find which cell types are enriched for genes with rare variants associated with Parkinsonism. MBDOP2 were the most significantly enriched (p\u0026lt;0.0001/231). We did not observe any significant enrichments in oligodendrocyte lineage for these rare variants.\nThis potentially indicates a difference between the common and rare variant forms of Parkinsons, or that the Parkinsonism associated variants are more directly related only to the prominent symptoms (note Parkinsonism!=Parkinsons).\nWe then used EWCE to find cell types altered in human post-mortem Parkinson’s disease brain. In three seperate studies, downregulated genes were specifically enriched in dopaminergic neurons, while upregulated genes were significantly enriched in oligodendrocyte lineage cells.\n  We then analysed data from post-mortem human brains which had been scored by neuropathologists for their Braak stage. This showed that upregulation of oligodendrocyte genes is already found at Braak stage 1\u0026frasl;2 which precedes dopaminergic neuron downregulation and degeneration.\n  These results not only support the genetic evidence indicating that oligodendrocytes may play a causal role in Parkinson’s disease, but indicate that their involvement precedes the emergence of pathological changes in neurons of the substantia nigra.\n","date":1550631465,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550631465,"objectID":"530b6ebdc431417a5b2d184937087aca","permalink":"/post/imp-perspectives/","publishdate":"2019-02-20T02:57:45Z","relpermalink":"/post/imp-perspectives/","section":"post","summary":"Our latest preprint on cell type mapping is now available on bioRxiv.\nThis work was a collaboration with the Hjerling-Leffler and Sullivan labs.

However, it remains unclear in which cell types these variants may be active, which is essential for understanding disease etiology and for disease modelling. Here we integrate GWAS results with single-cell transcriptomic data from the entire nervous system to systematically identify cell types underlying psychiatric disorders, neurological conditions, and other brain complex traits. We show that psychiatric disorders are predominantly associated with excitatory neurons from the cortex/hippocampus, medium spiny neurons from the striatum, diverse sets of midbrain neurons, and inhibitory neurons from the cortex/hippocampus. Cognitive traits were generally associated with similar cell types but their associations were driven by different genes. Neurological disorders were associated with different cell types, consistent with other lines of evidence. Notably, we found that Parkinsons disease is not only genetically associated with dopaminergic neurons but also with serotonergic neurons and cells from the oligodendrocyte lineage. Using post-mortem brain transcriptomic data, we confirmed alterations in these cells, even at the earliest stages of disease progression. Altogether, our study provides a solid framework for understanding the cellular basis of complex brain disorders and reveals a new unexpected role of oligodendrocytes in Parkinsons disease.","tags":null,"title":"Genetic Identification of Cell Types Underlying Brain Complex Traits Yields Novel Insights Into the Etiology of Parkinson's Disease","type":"publication"},{"authors":["I Jansen","J Savage","K Watanabe","J Bryois","D Williams","S Steinberg","J Sealock","I Karlsson","S Hagg","L Athanasiu","N Voyle","P Proitsi","A Witoelar","S Stringer","D Aarsland","I Almdahl","F Andersen","S Bergh","F Bettella","S Bjornsson","A Braekhus","G Brathen","C Leeuw","R Desikan","S Djurovic","L Dumitrescu","T Fladby","T Homan","P Jonsson","A Rongve","I Saltvedt","S Sando","G Selbak","N Skene","J Snaedal","E Stordal","I Ulstein","Y Wang","L White","J Hjerling-Leffler","P Sullivan","W van der Flier","R Dobson","L Davis","H Stefansson","K Stefansson","N Pedersen","S Ripke","O Andreassen","D Posthuma"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1546819200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546819200,"objectID":"7c78072483d93e7a763f267c48cedec0","permalink":"/publication/gwasalzh/","publishdate":"2019-01-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gwasalzh/","section":"publication","summary":"Late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with more than 35 million people affected worldwide, and no curative treatment available.

Here, we performed the largest genome-wide association study of clinically diagnosed AD and AD-by-proxy (71,880 AD cases, 383,378 controls). AD-by-proxy status is based on parental AD diagnosis, and showed strong genetic correlation with AD (rg=0.81). Genetic meta-analysis identified 29 risk loci, of which 9 are novel, and implicating 215 potential causative genes. Independent replication further supports these novel loci in AD. Associated genes are strongly expressed in immune-related tissues and cell types (spleen, liver and microglia). Furthermore, gene-set analyses indicate the genetic contribution of biological mechanisms involved in lipid-related processes and degradation of amyloid precursor proteins. We show strong genetic correlations with multiple health-related outcomes, and Mendelian randomisation results suggest a protective effect of cognitive ability on AD risk. These results are a step forward in identifying more of the genetic factors that contribute to AD risk and add novel insights into the neurobiology of AD to guide new drug development.","tags":null,"title":"Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies new loci and functional pathways influencing Alzheimer’s disease risk","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaoyan Qian","Kenneth D Harris","Thomas Hauling","Dimitris Nicoloutsopoulos","Ana Munoz Manchado","Nathan Skene","Jens Hjerling-Leffler","Mats Nilsson"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1538348400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538348400,"objectID":"df5489bc8d4686d7ae575ffef34a9a1e","permalink":"/publication/spatialatlas/","publishdate":"2018-10-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/spatialatlas/","section":"publication","summary":"Understanding the function of a tissue requires knowing the spatial organization of its constituent cell types.

Functional follow-up analyses showed enrichment in several brain regions and involvement of specific cell types, including dopaminergic neuroblasts (P=3.49×10−8), medium spiny neurons (P=4.23×10−8), and serotonergic neurons (P=1.37×10−7). Gene set analyses implicated three specific pathways: neurogenesis (P=4.43×10−9), behavioral response to cocaine processes (P=1.84×10−7), and axon part (P=5.26×10−8). We show that neuroticism’s genetic signal partly originates in two genetically distinguishable subclusters (‘depressed affect’ and ‘worry’), suggesting distinct causal mechanisms for subtypes of individuals. Mendelian randomization analysis showed unidirectional and bidirectional effects between neuroticism and multiple psychiatric traits. These results enhance neurobiological understanding of neuroticism and provide specific leads for functional follow-up experiments.","tags":null,"title":"Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for neuroticism in 449,484 individuals identifies novel genetic loci and pathways","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kenneth D Harris","Hannah Hochgerner","Nathan G Skene","Lorenza Magno","Linda Katona","Carolina Bengtsson Gonzales","Peter Somogyi","Nicoletta Kessaris","Sten Linnarsson","Jens Hjerling-Leffler"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1529276400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1529276400,"objectID":"d309208c7ecd24d33a98b3a3e864c7af","permalink":"/publication/kenharris-2018-ca1/","publishdate":"2018-06-18T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/kenharris-2018-ca1/","section":"publication","summary":"Understanding any brain circuit will require a categorization of its constituent neurons. In hippocampal area CA1, at least 23 classes of GABAergic neuron have been proposed to date. However, this list may be incomplete; additionally, it is unclear whether discrete classes are sufficient to describe the diversity of cortical inhibitory neurons or whether continuous modes of variability are also required. We studied the transcriptomes of 3,663 CA1 inhibitory cells, revealing 10 major GABAergic groups that divided into 49 fine-scale clusters. All previously described and several novel cell classes were identified, with three previously described classes unexpectedly found to be identical. A division into discrete classes, however, was not sufficient to describe the diversity of these cells, as continuous variation also occurred between and within classes. Latent factor analysis revealed that a single continuous variable could predict the expression levels of several genes, which correlated similarly with it across multiple cell types. Analysis of the genes correlating with this variable suggested it reflects a range from metabolically highly active faster-spiking cells that proximally target pyramidal cells to slower-spiking cells targeting distal dendrites or interneurons. These results elucidate the complexity of inhibitory neurons in one of the simplest cortical structures and show that characterizing these cells requires continuous modes of variation as well as discrete cell classes.","tags":null,"title":"Classes and continua of hippocampal CA1 inhibitory neurons revealed by single-cell transcriptomics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nathan G.

By applying knowledge of the cellular taxonomy of the brain from single-cell RNA sequencing, we evaluated whether the genomic loci implicated in schizophrenia map onto specific brain cell types. We found that the common-variant genomic results consistently mapped to pyramidal cells, medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and certain interneurons, but far less consistently to embryonic, progenitor or glial cells. These enrichments were due to sets of genes that were specifically expressed in each of these cell types. We also found that many of the diverse gene sets previously associated with schizophrenia (genes involved in synaptic function, those encoding mRNAs that interact with FMRP, antipsychotic targets, etc.) generally implicated the same brain cell types. Our results suggest a parsimonious explanation: the common-variant genetic results for schizophrenia point at a limited set of neurons, and the gene sets point to the same cells. The genetic risk associated with MSNs did not overlap with that of glutamatergic pyramidal cells and interneurons, suggesting that different cell types have biologically distinct roles in schizophrenia.","tags":null,"title":"Genetic identification of brain cell types underlying schizophrenia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonathan R.

We found weak genetic correlations with other sleep-related traits, but strong genetic correlations with psychiatric and metabolic traits.

A major lifespan landmark was the peak change in trajectories occurring in humans at 26 years and in mice at 5 months of age. This species-conserved peak was delayed in females and marked a reorganization of expression of synaptic and schizophrenia-susceptibility genes.

My interests lie in using human genetics to gain insight into the neurobiology of brain disorders and cognitive traits. Currently I am focused on identifying the causal cell types underlying complex genetic traits. The motivation for this is that traditional approaches to science have been unable to yield definitive answers on which cell types are the primary cause of major diseases, such as Schizophrenia or Alzheimers. For instance, as the primary pathology in Alzheimers is neuronal/synapse loss, it was reasonably assumed for many years that the cause was neuronal, however analysis of genetic associatons shows that most of the causal genes are expressed in microglia.\nI did my postdoctoral research at the Karolinska Institutet (KI) where I worked with Jens Hjerling-Leffler as part of the Functional Neuromics project. At KI we adapted single cell disassociation protocols such that we could obtain sufficient numbers of healthy interneurons from adult mice that we could catalogue the full complement of GABAergic cell types found in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. This work formed part of a broader effort to map all the cell types in the mouse nervous system using single cell RNA-sequencing (the completed atlas can be viewed here). To enable greater insight into which of these cell types play a role in human disease/cognition we begun collaborating with Patrick Sullivan\u0026rsquo;s psychiatric genetics team: together we established the methods which enabled us to map the cell types underlying Schizophrenia, Major Depression, IQ, Neuroticism, Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s and Insomnia. We released the MAGMA_Celltyping package to enable others to apply this method to future GWAS studies. The KI single cell superset data which we used for cell type mapping is available here.\nI gained an undergraduate degree in Artificial Intelligence and Cybernetics from the University of Reading in 2008, followed by an MPhil at the University of Cambridge in Computational Biology in 2009. I went onto do a PhD in Molecular Biology at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute working with Prof Seth Grant. During this time I worked on the Genes to Cognition programme, analysing the transcriptomic changes seen in a mice carrying a wide range of synaptic mutations.\nFollowing my PhD I worked at the University of Edinburgh, where I studied how postnatal gene expression changes influence the onset of psychiatric disorders. At this time I developed a method (Expression Weighted Celltype Enrichment) which made it possible to show that microglia are the celltype whose expression profile best explains the rare \u0026amp; common variant\u0026rsquo;s associated with Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s disease.\n","date":1461711600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461711600,"objectID":"d31b5bd2fded077ff18a7f2ffbbec6ec","permalink":"/people/nathanskene/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/people/nathanskene/","section":"people","summary":"An example of using the in-built project page.","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"Nathan Skene","type":"people"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461711600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461711600,"objectID":"2677e2ebce879634eca018666b7c441e","permalink":"/software/one2one/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/software/one2one/","section":"software","summary":"R package for finding 1:1 homologs between species","tags":["R"],"title":"One2one R Package","type":"software"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461711600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461711600,"objectID":"e590bd3f0c68fb324c58939464171b7c","permalink":"/datasets/allki/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/datasets/allki/","section":"datasets","summary":"Datasets associated with 2018 Nature Genetics paper with data on CA1, cortex, hypothalamus, striatum and midbrain","tags":["R"],"title":"allKI single cell RNA-seq dataset (expression and raw data)","type":"datasets"},{"authors":["Nathan G Skene","Seth GN Grant"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1453852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1453852800,"objectID":"cc74a67daff685b1ab13d83526dcc091","permalink":"/publication/ewce-2016/","publishdate":"2016-01-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ewce-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"The cell types that trigger the primary pathology in many brain diseases remain largely unknown. One route to understanding the primary pathological cell type for a particular disease is to identify the cells expressing susceptibility genes. Although this is straightforward for monogenic conditions where the causative mutation may alter expression of a cell type specific marker, methods are required for the common polygenic disorders. We developed the Expression Weighted Cell Type Enrichment (EWCE) method that uses single cell transcriptomes to generate the probability distribution associated with a gene list having an average level of expression within a cell type. Following validation, we applied EWCE to human genetic data from cases of epilepsy, Schizophrenia, Autism, Intellectual Disability, Alzheimer's disease, Multiple Sclerosis and anxiety disorders. Genetic susceptibility primarily affected microglia in Alzheimer's and Multiple Sclerosis; was shared between interneurons and pyramidal neurons in Autism and Schizophrenia; while intellectual disabilities and epilepsy were attributable to a range of cell-types, with the strongest enrichment in interneurons. We hypothesized that the primary cell type pathology could trigger secondary changes in other cell types and these could be detected by applying EWCE to transcriptome data from diseased tissue. In Autism, Schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease we find evidence of pathological changes in all of the major brain cell types. These findings give novel insight into the cellular origins and progression in common brain disorders. The methods can be applied to any tissue and disorder and have applications in validating mouse models.","tags":null,"title":"Identification of Vulnerable Cell Types in Major Brain Disorders Using Single Cell Transcriptomes and Expression Weighted Cell Type Enrichment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anna E Skrzypiec","Rahul S Shah","Emanuele Schiavon","Eva Baker","Nathan Skene","Robert Pawlak","Mariusz Mucha"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1365462000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1365462000,"objectID":"41c5504f079449375727f56bc1b7cc5f","permalink":"/publication/mariusz-2013/","publishdate":"2013-04-09T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mariusz-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"Behavioural adaptation to psychological stress is dependent on neuronal plasticity and dysfunction at this cellular level may underlie the pathogenesis of affective disorders such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Having previously demonstrated the role of lipocalin-2 (Lcn-2) in promoting stress-induced changes in dendritic spine morphology/function and neuronal excitability in the mouse hippocampus, we show here that the Lcn-2 gene is one of the most highly upregulated transcripts detected by microarray analysis in the amygdala after acute restraint-induced psychological stress. This is associated with increased Lcn-2 protein synthesis, which is found on immunohistochemistry to be predominantly localised to neurons. Stress-naïve Lcn-2−/− mice show a higher spine density in the basolateral amygdala and a 2-fold higher rate of neuronal firing rate compared to wild-type mice. Unlike their wild-type counterparts, Lcn-2−/− mice did not show an increase in dendritic spine density in response to stress but did show a distinct pattern of spine morphology.
