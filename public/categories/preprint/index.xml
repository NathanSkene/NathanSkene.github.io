      <description>Our latest preprint on cell type mapping is now available on bioRxiv.
This work was a collaboration with the Hjerling-Leffler and Sullivan labs. Some of the most exciting findings relate to Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease: we discover genetic associations with most the celltypes known to degenerate in the disease (suggesting this occurs cell autonomously) but also discovered a new link to Oligodendrocytes.
We tested for associations with 231 cell types from the mouse central, peripheral and enteric nervous systems.</description>
