      <description>We are looking to recruit talented researchers to join the lab. Currently we are particularly interested in computational researchers, or those with experience working with single cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq or post-mortem human brain tissue. However, people with more unconventional backgrounds would be most welcome: if you&amp;rsquo;ve been working in mathematics, engineering or computer science and are looking to get into biology then do get in touch.
Masters students are invited to get in touch about potential projects.</description>
